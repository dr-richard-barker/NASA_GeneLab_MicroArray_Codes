These codes were developed in collaboration with Ralph Møller Trane.
The bar plot code development continued and led to the creation of these two R-shiny websites.

For RootNav
https://rmtrane.shinyapps.io/RootNav/

For RootTrace
https://rmtrane.shinyapps.io/RootTrace/

In addition, these R-shiny sites were also found to be useful for creating Venn diagrams
