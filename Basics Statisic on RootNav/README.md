These codes were created as part of the Gilroy lab APEX5 project. It contains the statiscial analysis performed on the APEX5 SVT and EVT tests. In addition, this folder also contains codes used to perform statiscial analysis on Arabidopsis seedling grown in a hypoxic environment. In both example RootNav was used to analyse 300dpi images. 

These codes are based on the out put from the RootNav software.
